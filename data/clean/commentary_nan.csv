282,"goel to hussey, 1 run, similar ball, hussey tries to turn it and get two more, but they decide against it"

397,"amarnath to hopes, four runs, that's his fifty and he brings it up in style, cracked through midwicket for a blistering four, 24-ball half-century from hopes, what a cracker"
398,"amarnath to hopes, 1 run, dropped, that was crunched straight back at the bowler, he stretched his right hand out but saw the ball popping out, tough chance but one nevertheless"

424,"amarnath to sangakkara, 1 leg bye, tries to shuffle across and heave it over the leg side but can't make contact, has to be happy with a single"
425,"amarnath to yuvraj singh, six runs, there is goes, yuvraj tees off as only he can, smooth swing of the bat and rips that way over long-off for a six, 91 metres that one, what a monster. the king is here, long live the king"

436,"muralitharan to yuvraj singh, no run, good finish, two dots in a row, quicker one that is pushed back to the bowler"
437,"joginder sharma to sangakkara, 1 run, that is close! batsman makes room and gets one to midwicket, they think of a single but sangakkara needs to go back, he slips but makes a valiant attempt, no direct hit but dhoni grabs the ball and dislodges the bails, the third umpire is called up and this is really close. waiting, waiting .... and he's safe. it was a line call but the benefit had to go to the batsman."
438,"joginder sharma to yuvraj singh, out, huge wicket that silences the crowd! joginder takes off the pace and deceives yuvraj, big hit goes wrong, not much timing and amarnath comes around towards deep extra cover to take a sharp catch under pressure. yuvraj needs to go and punjab's hopes are slowly going up in smoke."

452,"gony to sangakkara, four runs, finall sangakkara gets the shot he's been looking for, walks across the stumps and shovels it over fine leg for a four, he's been looking for that shot for a while now."
460,"muralitharan to pathan, no run, pushed back to the bowler, fine over at this point, murali is quite a champion"
461,"oram to katich, 1 run, pushed to mid-on for a single, that's a good way to go about it"

9963,"ntini to salman butt, four runs, he slides it across the left hander again and butt makes room for himself, he plays this a lot squarer and slashes it with control over backward point"
9965,"ntini to salman butt, no run, good tactic by ntini as he pitches it on the corridor outside off and beats the batsman, the ball straightens after pitching"
9972,"gony to das, 1 run, gives him a bit of width outside off, he opens the face of the bat and pushes it wide of cover"
9975,"muralitharan to salman butt, no run, this one's flatter in trajectory, not much turn as he taps it to mid-off"

10032,"muralitharan to salman butt, no run, makes room to slice it wide of the infield on the offside but the big turn beats him"
10037,"ntini to hussey, out, timber and that;s two in two! ntini gets it to angle in to the right hander, that's his stock delivery, hussey is a little lazy to move across and cover the line and the ball skids through and hits the top of offstump, the stump goes for a tumble"
10041,"ntini to shukla, no run, ends a superb over with a dot ball, shukla taps it towards mid-off"
10044,"balaji to saha, 1 run, pushed to the offside for a single"
10045,"balaji to shukla, 1 wide, slips that wide outside off, loses his line here"
10046,"balaji to shukla, 1 run, the slower ball, he makes room and pushes it to long-off"
10049,"morkel to saha, 1 run, "
10053,"morkel to shukla, 1 bye, attempts to heave it through the on side, he misses and gets a bye as patel fumbles"
10055,"balaji to shukla, 1 leg bye, foxes him with the slower ball as he goes for the heave, the ball hits him just outside the line of the stumps but balaji appeals anyway"
10061,"shoaib akhtar to patel, 1 wide, bad start for shoaib as he slides this one down the legside, wide called"
10062,"shoaib akhtar to patel, 1 wide, this time he sprays it well wide of the offstump, that ankle must be disturbing his rhythm"
10070,"sharma to patel, no run, pitches on middle and comes on straight, he angles it down towards backward point, this is a good line by ishant"
10071,"sharma to patel, four runs, superb timing! ishant gives him just a bit of width outside off, he opens the face of the bat and meets the ball on an angle, he strikes it off the meat of the bat and the ball just beats the diving cover fielder"

10078,"shoaib akhtar to fleming, no run, gets a thick inside edge as he plays away from his body and the ball nearly trickles onto his stumps"

10088,"dinda to patel, no run, this one keeps a little low, he just manages to cover the line and tap it firmly back to the bowler"
10089,"dinda to patel, 1 run, slashes it hard along the ground and taibu effects a brilliant athletic save to his right and saves a certain boundary"
10092,"dinda to patel, no run, takes this from outside the offstump and whips across the line to midwicket with a good use of the wrists"
10096,"agarkar to patel, 1 run, swings in to the left hander and he tucks it to the on side after exposing his stumps"
10102,"dinda to fleming, 1 run, he taps it with soft hands towards mid-off and sets off quickly for a single, he takes advantage of the fact that the fielder is on the edge of the circle"
10104,"dinda to patel, 1 run, taps it just wide of shukla at mid-off and sets off, shukla for some reason hesitates before throwing and eventually knocks the stumps down after patel makes his ground, why did we wait? otherwise patel would have gone, surely!"

10113,"mcgrath to kallis, no run, outside off again, left alone, bharat chipli is kallis' opening partner"

10115,"mcgrath to kallis, 1 run, walks down the track and pushes back to the bolwer, mcgrath lets out a reverse flick that hits the stumps and deflects for an overthrow, they get a run."
10118,"sangwan to kallis, 1 wide, too wide outside off, starting wide and moving away, kallis throws his bat but can't reach it, wide called and rightly so"
10120,"sangwan to kallis, 5 wides, too wide again, he's sprayed that, too far for the wicketkeeper as well, all the way for four, this is erratic from sangwan"

10127,"mcgrath to chipli, 1 run, down the leg side and angled towards fine leg"
10130,"mcgrath to kallis, 1 run, flicked away to the on side, line slightly wrong that time"
10139,"mcgrath to kallis, 1 wide, that's harsh from the umpire, it was not too wide outside off but it's called a wide, kallis let it go and mcgrath can't believe it, he wasn't given a caught-behind in the last ball of the previous over and now this. surely no love lost between the aussies."
10143,"mcgrath to chipli, no run, that's spanked hard to point and some sensational fielding by dilshan, diving stop after throwing himself to the right, mcgrath gives the batsman more lip, he is furious now"
10145,"mcgrath to kallis, four runs, on middle and kallis moves across to turn it away crisply off his hips, all the way behind square for four, mcgrath is furious - this time with himself"
10147,"mahesh to goswami, no run, outside off this time and lets it go, two good dot balls from yomahesh"
10150,"mahesh to goswami, four runs, now that's a sweet shot, laced through the covers for a fine four, everything right about it, balance, timing and head position"
10157,"maharoof to goswami, 1 run, down the track and spanked away over infield for a single, maharoof rounds off a fine over"
10164,"maharoof to dravid, 1 run, pushed to mid-on and takes off, sensible decision to give goswami the strike, he's the man in form"

10189,"mahesh to goswami, 1 wide, gives himself a lot of room and that's called a wide, harsh one that, it wouldn't have been a wide if he was standing in his normal position"
10190,"mahesh to goswami, no run, backs off again and tries to judder it past cover but misses again, this is getting frustrating for goswami"
10192,"mahesh to misbah-ul-haq, 1 run, another tip and run to the off side, misbah's plan seems clear, get into the groove and smash later"
10202,"mahesh to goswami, no run, driven hard to point, dilshan isn't letting anything go by, two vital dots for yomahesh"
10203,"mahesh to goswami, four runs, top edge flies away past karthik, he's tried to lash it past cover but can only get an edge, that would have been a sensational catch but it races past karthik for four, goswami brings up a fifty in his ipl debut, take a bow little man, they'll be cheering in lilua (his hometown in bengal) for sure"
10207,"maharoof to goswami, out, down the track and tries to clear the midwicket region, bit of extra bounce for maharoof and the leading edge pops high in the air for dilshan, at point, to take a comfortable catch. end of a fine innings"

10232,"bhatia to misbah-ul-haq, no run, that's gold-dust at this point, a dot ball, misbah lets it go thinking it's a wide but not called, zaheer khan is halfway down the crease and needs to hurry back"
10234,"bhatia to misbah-ul-haq, six runs, slower but but misbah knows that, stand and deliver that, waits for it and swings it hard over midwicket for a six, he knew exactly what was coming"
10237,"steyn to gambhir, four runs, down the leg side and what a start from gambhir, flicked with sweet timing to the square leg fence for four, too easy for the man with the orange cap"

10240,"steyn to sehwag, 1 run, on middle and leg this time, turned away crisply behind square for a single"
10242,"steyn to gambhir, 4 leg byes, too far down leg side, that's too easy for gambhir, helped it down the leg side, four legbyes and steyn hasn't got his line right"
10244,"khan to gambhir, four runs, too far down leg, that's an awful line from zaheer, beats the batsman, beats the keeper, he can only get a glove to it but it's four"
10248,"khan to gambhir, 5 wides, another one that's way too wide down leg, no chance for goswami there, another four, more wides, this may be costly"
10255,"steyn to gambhir, four runs, bit of width and he's flayed that through the covers for another four, he's in such roaring form that a few good balls can only stiffen him up, what a zinger that was, four dots and two fours, gauti makes up for lost time"
10256,"khan to sehwag, 1 run, sensible from the captain, steering to third man and giving the strike to the man in form"
10257,"khan to gambhir, 1 run, on middle and off, keeps him quiet now, pushed to the off side for a quick single, better line from zaheer here"
10266,"kumar to gambhir, 1 run, sensible this time, taps with soft hands and takes off for a single to cover"
10267,"kumar to sehwag, four runs, he's motoring along too, on middle and leg and sehwag punishes that behind square, these two batsmen have murdered attacks all through this tournament and this doesn't look any different"
10270,"kallis to sehwag, 1 run, steered to third man, there's a misfield there but they settle for one"
10274,"kumar to gambhir, 1 run, down the track and driven to cover, good diving stop keeps them down to a single, that was travelling too"

10287,"akhil to gambhir, 1 run, on middle and leg, turned away to square leg for a single, sensible from gauti, he knows the run-rate is well within control"
10295,"kumble to de villiers, 1 run, driven to mid-on for an easy single"
10299,"akhil to de villiers, 2 runs, uppish this time, outside off but point can't get to it despite a diving attempt, they complete two more, these delhi batsmen are so quick between the wickets"
10306,"kumble to de villiers, 1 run, driven meatily through the covers for a single"
10312,"akhil to de villiers, 1 run, "
10315,"akhil to de villiers, 1 run, flicked to square leg for a single"
10316,"kumble to de villiers, 1 run, quicker one down the leg side, ab was giving him the charge but he made the late change kumble, ab needs to make the change to push to the on side"
10317,"kumble to dilshan, 1 run, dilshan makes room and drives through the covers"
10332,"kumble to maharoof, 1 run, quicker one on middle, turned away to the leg side for a quick single, good fielding at square leg but they're home"
10333,"kumble to dhawan, no run, more drama! dhawan pushes back to the bowler, it appeared like a bump ball but kumble completed a low catch and claims it, the fielders look pretty confident but the umpire is not sure, the third umpire is called upon but the evidence is not conclusive. 'not out' says the third umpire"
10336,"steyn to dhawan, 1 run, slower one from steyn, dhawan is foxed by it and the tentative chip falls in the gap in the covers, that could have easily been caught"
10339,"steyn to maharoof, 1 leg bye, backs away again but steyn follows him, struck on the body but they manage a leg bye, end of a ferocious spell but delhi could just get past the tape here"
10340,"khan to maharoof, four runs, what a statement! maharoof dances down the track and rips a powerful drive through the covers, that's pinged the boundary hoardings hard and they're almost there now"
10343,"khan to dhawan, four runs, straight and coming into the left-hander, he tries to loft it over mid-on but a thick inside edge has sneaked the gap between mid-on and midwicket, all the way for four, all over bar the shouting now"
10348,"sohail tanvir to salman butt, 2 wides, down the leg side, starts with a wide, it's pakistan v pakistan first up, two slips in place and there seems to be a bit of swing around"
10353,"sohail tanvir to salman butt, no run, on middle and leg again, he hasn't got the line going here, turned away but they decide against the single"
10360,"patel to ganguly, no run, fine over this, wicket maiden that, tapped to the off side, super stuff from munaf"
10364,"watson to salman butt, 1 wide, drifting down the leg side now, that's wide in this format, butt tries to flick but can't make contact"
10366,"watson to salman butt, no run, tapped to cover"
10367,"watson to salman butt, no run, similar ball again, driven straight to mid-off again, tight over this, just five off it"
10368,"sohail tanvir to ganguly, no run, good line this, doesn't allow him a chance to free his arms, tapped to cover"
10369,"sohail tanvir to ganguly, no run, jags back into the left hander, surprises him and he has no stroke for that, they think of a quick run but decide against it"
10371,"sohail tanvir to ganguly, no run, superb slower ball here, surprises ganguly and he can only push it tentatively to cover, the crowd are getting into this now, boos go around"
10378,"patel to ganguly, no run, signs of frustration here, ganguly backs off and tries to whack that over mid-on but can't get the timing right, dribbled to mid-on"
10379,"patel to ganguly, 1 run, walks down the track again, ganguly doesn't have much of a clue but is trying to clear the field, thick inside edge goes to square leg, even dada is smiling by the end of it"
10382,"watson to salman butt, 1 run, backs away, tries to lash it through the off side but can't beat the fielder, they hurry a single, this is tight bowling here"
10384,"watson to salman butt, 1 run, 135.1, fine change of pace, pushed to the on side, only one again"
10388,"patel to salman butt, four runs, that's the shot of the evening, gives himself room, sees the ball thrown up little wide but he's flayed that through the covers on one knee, classical mixes with improvisation there, eden is alive and well"
10391,"patel to hussey, no run, left alone outside off, moving a shade away, successful over again"
10395,"trivedi to ganguly, no run, another slower one, not coming onto the bat, ganguly needs to wait an age for it and can't work it away, dribbles to slip"
10406,"trivedi to hussey, four runs, down the leg side this time, trivedi is having a poor over here, helped along past the keeper for four, two rank balls here"
10410,"warne to ganguly, 2 runs, legbreak that's on off, turns into the left-hander, ganguly backs away and flays it hard towards extra cover, they pick up a couple"
10412,"warne to ganguly, 1 run, turned to the on side, that was a legbreak which turned a bit more"
10418,"pathan to ganguly, 1 run, tapped to the off side, quick run too, quickish from yusuf"
10421,"pathan to das, 1 run, 97.2kph, fired in on middle and leg, turned away for a single"
10423,"warne to das, six runs, ladies and gentlemen, introducing debabrata, down the track and swings clean, what a shot, whistles towards the sight-screen for a biggie, shane is a bit stunned, eden is abuzz, that's as smooth a straight hit as you will see tonight."
10428,"pathan to ganguly, 1 run, quicker one outside off, tries to angle past third man but it's a fine bit of fielding by munaf, keeps them to a single"
10432,"pathan to das, 1 run, crisply smashed to midwicket but only a single, he's hitting them clean here"
10434,"trivedi to ganguly, 1 run, slower one again, trivedi is a slower bowler, guys, let's face it, glided away to third man"
10453,"sohail tanvir to shukla, 1 run, played towards point once again"
10464,"sohail tanvir to umar gul, no run, round the wicket and the most tantalising slower ball of the night, 99kph and gul has no clue of when that's going to reach him, loops to the keeper"
10480,"sharma to asnodkar, four runs, that's romesh kaluwitharana at his best, swapnil waits there and lashes that hard thorough the covers, not a man move, eden stunned, what a creamer that was, the goa canon is on his way"
10481,"sharma to asnodkar, out, that's the breakthrough, swinging away from asnodkar and he's thrown his bat at it wildly, tries to smash it through the covers but only manages an outside edge to the keeper, important wicket for ishant, asnodkar can be dangerous"
10482,"dinda to smith, no run, left alone outside off"
10487,"dinda to smith, 1 run, glided away to third man for a single"
10488,"sharma to smith, four runs, that's a fine shot, slightly outside off and smith uses the pace of the ball to glide it expertly behind point for four, that's class"
10490,"sharma to smith, 1 run, another risky run and hafeez misses a direct hit, turned to square leg and they take off but that was too reckless, a direct hit there and smith was gone"
10492,"sharma to smith, no run, tries to glide one past point again but can't beat the field"
10493,"sharma to smith, 1 run, tip and run there, these two batsmen seem to have a good understanding"
10495,"agarkar to smith, four runs, spanked that one, moved away outside off and ripped that through point for four, raced away, that's beefy"
10496,"agarkar to smith, 1 run, sensible stuff here, a tap and a run that follows a four, experience coming into play here"
10497,"agarkar to sohail tanvir, four runs, that's languid, stands and smashes one matter-of-factly through mid-on for four, that's as calm as it gets, what a shot"
10502,"umar gul to smith, no run, cracked to point but that's well fielded by hussey"
10506,"agarkar to kaif, 1 run, pushed through cover, finds the gap and takes a single"
10509,"agarkar to watson, 1 run, runs another one down to third man, easily done, he's getting into his groove here"
10511,"agarkar to kaif, no run, tapped to point, some tight bowling here but kolkata need wickets, if these two batsmen get set, expect the runs to flow, and there's yusuf and jadeja to come later"
10519,"agarkar to watson, no run, punches to cover, not taking any risk here, but watson can suddenly explode and nobody will know what's hit them, he's been the player of the tournament so far"
10524,"agarkar to watson, four runs, smashed away through midwicket, not neatly timed but that's racing away to the fence for four, what a shot"
10525,"ganguly to kaif, 1 run, kaif stays in his crease and drives the ball behind point to third man"
10527,"ganguly to watson, four runs, deft touch, watson stays in his crease, waits for the ball to angle into him and opens the face at the very last moment to play the ball fine towards third man"
10534,"umar gul to pathan, four runs, fortune favours yusuf, he tries to loft it over midwicket but an inside edge runs away past the keeper for four, streaky but that will work"
10537,"ganguly to kaif, no run, 112kph, in the corridor outside off, driven to cover, can't find the gap"
10539,"ganguly to kaif, 1 run, turned away from outside off to midwicket, they think of two but 'no' is the loud call, yusuf is a hare between the stumps too"
10544,"dinda to kaif, 1 run, what a chance! driven to cover and yusuf has backed up too far, he is mid-way down the pitch and kaif needs to go for it, the fielder at cover misses the direct hit, he could have lobbed it back to the bowler and yusuf might have still been out, things not going kolkata's way at the moment"
10547,"dinda to kaif, 1 run, 130kph, driven to cover, diving stop that keeps them down"
10549,"shukla to pathan, 2 runs, turned behind square and they rush back for a couple, that was a dangerous second but the throw is awry and yusuf gets there without much of a problem"
10552,"shukla to pathan, 1 run, he's tired after all those twos, drives half-heartedly to midwicket for a single"
10554,"shukla to kaif, 1 leg bye, another missed chance, kolkata aren't fielding anywhere near their best here, tapped to point and butt misses another direct hit, kaif would have been out of the crease again, these two batsmen are being reckless with their running and kolkata are not capitalising"
10561,"sharma to kaif, no run, tapped to point"
10566,"sharma to kaif, 2 runs, rocks back and pushes through covers, and they've scampered two again, how can kolkata allow that, the fielder is slow and the throw isn't too straight, kaif is speeding as if it's his last game, rajasthan are taking the mickey out of kolkata here, eden has been silenced"
10571,"umar gul to pathan, six runs, what a way to finish! yusuf has done it in style, chips it way over square leg for a big six, he's turned this match around in a trice and stands at the non-striker's end and flexes his muscles at his team-mates. they've plucked the chestnuts out of the fire here. in the semi-finals for sure now, rajasthan. and they truly deserve to be the first team to do so."
10572,"pollock to marsh, no run, shaun v shaun.... pollock has his say early on as he slants it across the left hander and marsh lets it go"
10573,"pollock to marsh, 1 run, gives him the same amount of width and he angles it just wide of point to get the innings off the mark"
10576,"pollock to pomersbach, no run, slants it across the left hander this time and pomersbach wisely chooses to let it go"
10577,"pollock to pomersbach, 2 runs, tries to break the shackles by dancing down the track but he mistimes the loft, the ball swirls in the air for a long time and fernando isn't quick enough to run back from mid-off and take it"
10582,"nehra to pomersbach, no run, gets this one to nip back in only slightly, he gets behind the line and defends"
10583,"nehra to pomersbach, no run, can't beat mid-off again i'm afraid, this time he takes a couple of paces down the track and slams it straight to the fielder who's a bit deep"
10584,"pollock to marsh, no run, false stroke, he sees the ball angling across him and has a waft at it without moving his feet"
10585,"pollock to marsh, no run, adjusts the line and brings it closer to the left hander this time, he defends and angles it square of the wicket"
10589,"pollock to pomersbach, no run, lovely delivery, the slower one, he taps it back to the bowler"
10591,"nehra to marsh, 1 run, gives him a bit of width outside off and he deftly angles it down to third man"
10592,"nehra to pomersbach, no run, swing and a miss, the ball stops a bit after pitching and his swing across the line meets thin air, that wasn't too far from the stumps either"
10597,"pollock to marsh, 1 run, opens the face of the bat and angles it wide of point"
10600,"pollock to marsh, 2 runs, excellent running! he tucks it softly towards midwicket and sets off quickly, two fielders converge but they're a bit lazy in getting to it and the batsmen seize the chance to take another run"
10606,"yeligati to marsh, no run, gives it plenty of air outside leg and marsh this time fails to whip it away wide of midwicket"
10609,"chitnis to marsh, 2 runs, steps down and whips it wide of square leg, nayar loses his shoe as he bends to pick it up"

31378,"raina to sharma, 1 run, rohit times the extra cover push really well and badri does well to keep it down to a single"
31379,"randiv to sharma, six runs, rohit has hit that almost out of the wankhede. typical shot to being up a 50, it lands in the third tier over long off. randiv tosses it up from round the stumps, rohit charges out and launches him clean and high."

32559,"pathan to kallis, out, irfan's classical inducker has struck, but not the way you would expect it to. as always it lands on off and middle and curls in, searching for the bat-pad gap, but kallis has bounded outside off stump already. he ends up well outside and looks to flick as the ball moves in sharply, and kallis' glance can't make contact. leg stump. clatter."

38228,"vettori to franklin, no run, can't get him away, pushed back to the bowler"
38230,"vettori to sharma, no run, tight over from dan, rohit can only stab a flatter one away on the off side"

38246,"syed mohammad to franklin, 1 run, looks to walk down the track, but this is a very flat trajectory that he is bowling, and franklin has to be content to push it on the off side"

38482,"ashwin to vettori, out, this final has lost more fizz than yesterday's beer can that was accidentally left open. vettori goes for a blob, a tame leading edge back to ashwin as he looks to work an offbreak to the leg side. vettori looks sheepish and gutted at the same time."

38524,"jakati to khan, no run, zaheer can't connect with the big hit this time."
38528,"jakati to tiwary, 1 run, as comical as they come. tiwary looks to slug over the leg side, mis-hits the ball, loses his grip on the bat and the willow nearly travels further than the leather. always a poor sign that, for a batsman."
38530,"bollinger to khan, 2 runs, another drop in the deep. csk are finally dropping their guard. zaheer looks to hoist bollinger over long off, and mukund, subbing for vijay, was running in. he should have held on low, but he spilt it."

38686,"morkel to tendulkar, no run, what a corker of a reply from morkel, angled in and zipping away from sachin, no way of playing that, lucky not to edge it, or get bowled, that wasn't far from the stumps"

52539,"narine to russell, out, this was coming , russell really didn't have much of an idea of what narine was bowling, he closes the face much too early to a legspinner and that lobs up off the leading edge to narine, who collects that easily, doesn't bother celebrating, just drops the ball at his feet, 'boringly easy this is,' he seems to be saying"
52541,"lee to jayawardene, 1 run, backs away from the stumps, was looking to hit towards off, somehow gets it away to the right of the bowler"

56301,"binny to rayudu, out, gone now, run-out, don't know though! that's gone, one of them is gone, flicked away to the leg side by rayadu and he was off for a single, harbhajan was never interested and both the batsmen were at the same end! both were at hand-shaking distance from each other although at that stage it seemed like they wanted to do anything but shake hands, in the end the third umpire has to intervene and send harbhajan on his way!"
56302,"binny to johnson, no run, inside edge now and it has not carried through to the keeper, wow, some more swing!"

56327,"cooper to malinga, 1 run, "

58179,"bhatia to pollard, four runs, inside edge and rolls over to the very fine, fine-leg fence for a four, the edge could have gone anywhere including the stumps, but misses the stumps by a whisker!"

58183,"senanayake to sharma, 1 run, reaches out to the delivery that's outside the off stump and pushes it to the leg side for a single"

58201,"balaji to pollard, no run, and now balaji is trying to bowl at bhatia's speeds, the ball just does not come on to the bat and he's already played the stroke twice, beats the outside edge"

58222,"balaji to rayudu, 1 run, angles back into the batsman who opens the face of the bat and guides it to backward point for a single"
58234,"sharma to vihari, 1 run, this time he affords slightly more width to the batsman who opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third-man for a single, there seemed to be a lot of bounce on that one"

58241,"holder to dhawan, no run, opens the face of the bat but is only able to dab it away to the point fielder"
58242,"holder to dhawan, 2 runs, up and over and almost for a four, but that's well fielded by mohit sharma who dives to his left and fields it, restricts it to a couple"
58243,"holder to dhawan, out, gone, run-out, that's surely gone i think but we have a third-ump decision pending! yep, that's out, dhawan had pushed the ball into the covers and he wanted the single, the non-striker was a tad slow in responding to the call and raina swoops down quickly and throws the stumps down at the striker's end, gone!"
58247,"sharma to dhawan, no run, pushed into the covers but to the fielder again, four dots to follow two good overs"
58248,"sharma to dhawan, 1 run, he was looking to run down the pitch yet again but this time the bowler pitches it further up, almost yorks him, dhawan pushes into the covers and runs across for a run"
58255,"holder to white, 2 runs, on the middle stump and white is able to just nudge it away through mid-wicket for a couple of runs, this looks like a good batting pitch so far, lot of bounce"
58256,"sharma to dhawan, four runs, crashed through backward point for a four! shot sir, that's again a shimmy down the wicket, the third time he's done that to sharma, but this time there's width created and cracked it away"

58278,"ashwin to mishra, 1 run, goes down the track, and wants to drill it through the covers, inside edge through that beats dhoni"
58280,"morris to mishra, no run, outside the off stump, not wide enough to be called one, mishra was moving towards the leg side too and lets it go through to the keeper"
58287,"ashwin to mishra, no run, leading edge and it almost carries to badri at cover, he was running towards it but catches it on the bounce"
58288,"ashwin to mishra, 1 run, was trying to hit it over the top again, gets it off the middle but no power and it goes to long-off this time"

58324,"bravo to thalaivan sargunam, no run, swing, an across line hoick, but the lack of pace from bravo beats the outside edge. in fact, tell you what, he had played it way earlier"
58335,"bravo to ashish reddy, 1 run, round the stumps and hits it flat, straight to vijay at long-off, that almost looked like it was running away from the fielder"
58336,"bravo to sammy, out, gone, caught at backward point! it was outside the off stump but no pace there from bravo, he was looking to drill it through the covers, the lack of pace defeats him and the drilled stroke goes to hand, morris grabs it easily"
58337,"bravo to dhawan, 1 run, slower one and he opens the face of the bat, looks to guide it over the fielder, gets only a single"
58343,"sharma to dhawan, no run, was looking to drive it through the covers yet again but the lack of pace helps the bowler, gets a mistimed shot back to him"
58346,"sharma to dhawan, four runs, and another one, four through the extra-cover region, another excellent over for the sunrisers as he smashes it through the in-field"
58351,"bravo to ashish reddy, four runs, and now over the off side, this is a good display of batting from reddy, it was outside the off and he slices it over the in-field for a four"

58355,"sammy to vijay, no run, outside the off stump, bit of movement away from the bat, he shoulders arms this time"
58360,"i sharma to vijay, 1 wide, down the leg side, and vijay was looking to flick it away over the leg side, walks too far across and misses, still it's a wide"
58366,"steyn to hussey, 1 wide, wide outside the off stump, angling away from the left-hander, lets it go through to the keeper for a wide"
58380,"kv sharma to vijay, no run, spin away from the batsman, he was looking to defend and the spin beats vijay's bat"

58433,"sammy to dhoni, 1 run, tucked away to the leg side for a quick single, there was a bit of a misfield from mishra but prevents the second"
58447,"kv sharma to bravo, no run, appeal for stumping and the third ump is called for. it was a good, quickish leggie, turns away from the batsman, bravo was looking to defend at it, de kock whips it off quickly but it looks like bravo has his boot down just in time. the problem is that the boot comes up after the bails are out of the slot, which is allowed...not-out is the call"
58450,"kv sharma to bravo, no run, and again spins across the batsman, beats the outside edge, make that four dots in this over"
58452,"kv sharma to bravo, no run, would you believe it, we have a maiden in the 16th over of the innings, karan sharma has ended with figures of 0/8 in four overs!"
58457,"steyn to bravo, no run, and another one, dot that is, on the off stump and that's only pushed to the off side, not for a single now"
58459,"i sharma to bravo, 2 runs, wants to work it to the leg side, gets bit of an inside edge and they are able to get back for the second run, there was a bit of a misunderstanding between the two but easily come back"
58466,"steyn to dhoni, four runs, up and over, that wasn't the most clever delivery from steyn, the fielder was inside the circle on the off side and steyn gave him room outside the off and he scoops it over the point region for a four"
58469,"steyn to jadeja, out, gone, caught at point! that was smashed to the point region but it went straight to the fielder and is caught, jadeja's got to walk. checking for the no-ball but he's not transgressed there."

58474,"ashish reddy to dhoni, four runs, no, no, no, what have you done there? that's wide down the leg side and there was no way the keeper could get close to it, gets some bat on it and it's gone through for a four."

58548,"balaji to hussey, 1 run, quicker for bala, is angling back into the batsman, who is not able to get it away, it gets away to the off side"
58550,"balaji to vohra, four runs, edged and through the right of the keeper for a four, it was pitched right up to the bat and the batsman was probably walking down to play a stroke before tapping out his bat, gets an edge"
58552,"balaji to vohra, out, but now he's caught at deep cover! six and out is what brett lee would say in the dugout, it was wide and he went over the in-field on the square boundary off-side, not able to time it well, straight to the fielder at deep cover"
58557,"narine to miller, no run, almost a wicket, he was going for a drive but the spin away from the batsman beats the outside edge"

58579,"kallis to hussey, out, goes over the top and very well caught by senanayake! it was not a quick one, he got it high and almost handsome, the fielder was right on the edge of the circle and is able to judge that well enough to pouch it, another wicket at a crucial time for kallis"

58591,"balaji to gurkeerat singh, six runs, and this time he's got it a six! seemed to have come off the bottom of the blade but the man has enough power to get it over the straight boundary for maximum"
58597,"kumar to gambhir, no run, ooh, almost an outside edge, it was deviating slightly away from the bat and gg wanted to open the face of the bat as he usually loves doing, misses the outside edge"
58603,"azhar mahmood to gambhir, out, bowled him, gone, swinging in and the stumps are down! not the best of shots but you got to give it to the bowler, that one was swinging back into the batsman who wanted to slam it over the mid-wicket region, hits something on the way before going on and hitting the stumps"
58604,"azhar mahmood to pathan, out, edged and gone! first ball! on a hat-trick! that's pushed and the nick goes through to the keeper, gilly dives to his right and is easily caught by him, that's a poor prod from pathan"
58610,"kumar to kallis, 1 run, walks a tad towards the ball, outside the off and pushes it to mid-off, goes for a run and chawla has a shy at it, misses"
58611,"kumar to bisla, no run, a tad wider outside the off stump and he is only able to push it to the off side, straight to a fielder"
58613,"kumar to bisla, no run, keeps a tad low to go with the fact that it was swinging away from the bat too, pushed to the covers"

60061,"perera to rayudu, four runs, what a shot! there was no deep fielder on the off side and the batsman was looking to go across the off side and hit it over the leg-side, the ball was wide outside the off and he slices it over the in-field!"

60207,"morkel to pathan, no run, swings at it against morne morkel and misses it by a mile, this was swinging away from the batsman and he does not give himself any time to have a look at him"
60211,"morkel to pathan, out, and that's gone very high, and tell you what, pathan's caught pathan! again the swing of the bat, but this time it does not come off the middle, and the edge of the bat means that it's gone high, in fact very high, takes a lot of time to come down which means that irfan has to account for a bit of swirl too and he manages to take it, well caught!"
60214,"pathan to morgan, no run, and another one that swings away from the batsman, he lets it go through to the keeper"

60318,"lee to sehwag, 1 run, and again, likes to open the face of the bat and run it through to third-man for a single"
60320,"kallis to sehwag, no run, and now goes to slash it away, misses the outside edge of the bat and through to the keeper"
60325,"balaji to jayawardene, out, edged and gone again, it is a very similar looking dismissal, he was looking to drive it this time and the edge carries through to the lone slip in place, kallis catches it well to push them back"
60327,"balaji to warner, four runs, slightly further wider outside the off and warner is able to drive it through the wide mid-off region for a four, not your typical hard-hit strokes, more of a well-placed one"

60355,"bhatia to warner, no run, outside the off stump and it seemed to have held up, warner was only able to push it to point"
60359,"bhatia to warner, four runs, slower from bhatia, he opens the face of the bat and guides it through third-man for a four, the fielder was within the circle and easily beat him"
60360,"bhatia to warner, no run, missed, stumping chance! it was an off-spinner from bhatia and warner had advanced down the track, misses his outside edge and should have been easily stumped, bisla gets it on his gloved but fails to collect it cleanly, second miss from the kkr"

62619,"cooper to marsh, out, and now he's bowled off a slower one! does not give too much pace on it, does not pitch it up either which means that he's got to make his own pace, he tries to do that by hitting it across the line, misses and the top of the middle stump is rattled"
62622,"faulkner to sathish, 2 runs, slower one, rolls his fingers over the ball and he's able to hit it through extra-cover"

62682,"gony to rahane, six runs, goes down the track and times it over long-off for a six! rahane does not hit them too hard but his timing is enough to get them just over the ropes, he seems to be choosing the gaps well too!"
62690,"awana to rahane, 1 wide, and this is even wider down the leg side from the bowler, easily left alone and equally easy for the ump to call a wide"

62730,"awana to rahane, no run, outside the off stump and he looks to open the face of the bat, not for runs"
62733,"awana to rahane, six runs, shot, shot, shot, that's some aggression, it was right up to the bat and he goes back, opens up his stance and cracks it over mid-wicket for a maximum!"

62776,"kaul to pujara, four runs, and for the third time, he looks to hit it hard, he goes down and spanks it away, straight-smashed for a four"
62777,"kaul to pujara, out, and again, but does not successful, bowled! it's been a surprising innings from pujara, almost as if he had taken over the role of hitting from gayle, was giving the bowler the charge again but the ball beats the bat, goes between the willow and pad and timber!"
62781,"yadav to henriques, 2 runs, inside edged and this almost goes to the fence, the ball come on slower than he expected and gets the toe, goes to the fine, fine-leg area where nadeem slides and stops it"

62799,"yadav to kohli, 1 run, continues that off stump line and kohli easily opens the face of the bat and pushes it to the point region, there's bit of a misfiled and they are through for one"

62859,"kaul to de villiers, no run, down the leg side and that seems to have hit his foot, he was looking to leave and it hits his boot, rolls over and the ump calls it a dead ball for not offering a shot"

68655,"sharma to mandeep singh, out, walks down, makes room and carves this straight down third man's throat. that was not his job, all he needed to do was put sehwag on strike but he couldn't help himself. tried to manufacture a stroke but gets more of a thick outside edge"
68656,"sharma to sehwag, four runs, this seemed to bounce a little more off the pitch. mohit has a knack for that and though sehwag was surprised, he drew his bottom hand off the bat and placed the steer past the waiting man at gully."

68786,"sandeep sharma to mccullum, 2 runs, chips down the track but his launch over the top came off the bottom of the bat. gained way more height than he liked and mitch was chasing after it. lunged after it with both hands but he never looked in control. swirler that was, no one would blame johnson for not grabbing that"
68788,"sandeep sharma to raina, 1 run, grants him width and raina smacks it over the covers. but there is protection in the deep"
68791,"patel to raina, 1 run, pushes it through at the base of middle, raina looks to flick across the line and is lucky for that ball deflecting away from the stumps"
68796,"maxwell to mccullum, 1 wide, stays around the wicket to the right-hander too, but this is fired in way too wide outside off"
68797,"maxwell to mccullum, 1 run, pushed back towards the bowler, maxi tries a flick off the back of his hand to try and run raina out and he would have been had that hit the target"

68840,"patel to dhoni, no run, chopped back to the bowler as he doesn't afford him any room"

68887,"richardson to finch, 1 run, interesting! he walks out of the crease to punch his first delivery, gets an inside edge back towards the non-striker and the bowler is not able to bend down in time.. giving finch his first run"
68892,"richardson to dhawan, four runs, he offers a lot of width this time and dhawan obliges by cracking it past a diving backward point to the boundary"

73943,"de lange to karthik, out, when a tall fast bowler is delivering at 140 kph plus, moving across your stumps towards the off and exposing all of them while trying to scoop is probably not the best choice of shot. karthik tried it and his middle and leg stumps took a hit"
73955,"gopal to tiwary, 1 run, played to backward point for a quick single"
73959,"de lange to tiwary, no run, a big appeal from the keeper tare as the ball slants down leg side and the batsman tries to glance, might have brushed the body"

74076,"tewatia to marsh, 1 wide, this was too wide outside off"

74082,"cooper to marsh, 1 run, gives him a lot of width this time and he dabs it down to third man"
74086,"faulkner to saha, no run, close call for saha as he pokes at one moving away and nearly edges it"
74088,"faulkner to saha, four runs, that was smashed past backward point, faulkner makes the mistake by giving him width outside off, bends slightly, gets beside the line and thrashes it"

74633,"steyn to gambhir, four runs, that rocketed to the boundary, think third man took about three or four steps before that reached the fielder there, bhuvneshwar looks to stop that with his legs after sliding, but that ball was really travelling, gambhir just used the pace of the bowler to slap it from off side"
74634,"steyn to gambhir, no run, this is driven towards mid-on, not too well timed"
74640,"holder to gambhir, out, bowled 'im! the sort of dismissal which we have seen so many times from gambhir, once again he looks to steer the ball to third man, inside edges onto the stumps, this match is utterly packed with incident"

74704,"awana to pietersen, no run, good stop. akshar dives to his left and saves what might well be four runs, after kp walks across his stumps and flicks it from outside off. a big chip seems to have come off the bottom of his bat."
74706,"awana to pietersen, four runs, direct hit! the man at point throws hard and flat to the bowler's end after kp sends agarwal back. the fielder was maxwell, who picked up this open-faced dab from kp after the ball seamed away from him slightly. the diving agarwal is home, and delhi get four overthrows."
74732,"awana to karthik, out, got him! did that straighten a bit? maybe. dk was back in his crease, and he tried to flick it from off stump towards midwicket, but he ends up getting a leading edge that loops into point's hands."

74754,"karanveer singh to pietersen, 1 run, kp gives himself room and tries to drive wristily through cover, but he's too early into his shot, and the ball trickles into the leg side off his inside edge"
74758,"dhawan to tiwary, out, what are you doing, delhi? has tiwary sacrificed his wicket, or has kp just run past him? tiwary bunted that straight to point, and kp just took off. bailey is the fielder, and he only has to lob it underarm to the bowler to complete the simplest of run-outs."
74759,"dhawan to pietersen, no run, slower ball, angled in towards middle stump, defended down the pitch"
74784,"dhawan to nadeem, no run, that's banged in, and it rises up towards shahbaz's throat. jumps up to keep it down."

75960,"chawla to vohra, out, he almost fluffed the chance! vohra wanted to send this to mg road, but gets a big edge that looped high up in the night sky. chawla calls early, gets under it.. but the ball bobs out of his hands.. it actually hits him on his face.. and bounces of his mouth. he is relieved to see it's still in his hands later. gambhir is relieved too.. wait a second.. relief? who's next?"
75961,"chawla to saha, four runs, murdered! call 100.. this is carnage. flatter deliver on off, saha has whacked this so hard past the umpire that no one in the field moves"

79199,"malinga to mccullum, 1 run, pace off the ball brings a miscue as mccullum looks for a smash through the covers, and ends up with an inside edge towards square leg"
79213,"harbhajan singh to mccullum, four runs, pierces the gap between cover and mid-off and it seems rohit has damaged his shoulder badly! it was a bullet drive from baz and it seemed destined for four. rohit threw himself after the ball on the cusp of the boundary, much like baz does, but he has landed awkwardly on his right shoulder. seems to have shaken it off. windmilling that hand now."
79217,"harbhajan singh to smith, 1 run, nudged towards the gap at midwicket and smith has his fifty. csk at 90 for 0, second-highest score in the powerplay in ipl. csk have the record as well, 100 v kings xi last year"

79302,"b kumar to agarwal, out, there we go! lovely line just outside off and agarwal was tempted by third man a bit too much. flashed the angled blade and presents slip-catching practice to dhawan"
79303,"b kumar to duminy, no run, huge appeal! jp had jumped right across to try and sneak a single behind square leg. kept seriously low and hit him adjacent with middle, that's why bhuvi was instant with his appeal. but it pitched outside leg"
79304,"b kumar to duminy, no run, no bounce again! this was pitching closer on the stumps and jp shuffles in line and brings down his bat just in time"
79322,"p kumar to iyer, four runs, that's a skier! steyn chases after it towards the straight boundary. but it appears to have been in vain. he caught up with it, was flicking the ball back into play when it touched the advertising triangles. shreyas was fooled by the ball holding in the deck and hitting him high on the bat as he wanted to loft through the line"
79328,"bopara to iyer, 1 run, looks to slice the ball behind point, can't succeed it. morgan tries to catch the striker out of his ground, but the man backing up inside the 30-yard circle fails to back up and dhawan behind him misfields as well! comedy of the year"
79329,"bopara to duminy, 2 runs, slower ball, lovely change of pace from bopara, as duminy looks to bring his bat down to block. gets an inside edge into vacant infield on leg. races for a couple and the deep fielders are too late to respond. warner is not pleased"
79331,"bopara to iyer, 1 run, third slowy on the trot and shreyas sends it to deep midwicket"
79337,"sharma to iyer, six runs, runs at the bowler, reaches the pitch and wallops him into the sightscreen to bring up the daredevils fifty! brilliant footwork form shreyas, didn't give the bowler any indication of his intentions until it was too late"

79370,"bopara to duminy, no run, well directed slower ball a shade outside off, duminy looks to slide it towards point for a single but there isn't one there"
79391,"ashish reddy to yuvraj singh, out, what. a. catch! warner has done it again! this was a long hop that was sailing beyond the midwicket boundary, but warner waits for it. he times his jump with insane precision and thrusts his hands over head and grabs a stunner with the boundary inches from his feet as he comes down! boy, is he pumped!"
79398,"b kumar to jadhav, 2 runs, "
79403,"p kumar to jadhav, 1 run, runs down the track, but yorks himself. manages to direct the ball to deep midwicket for a single"

79444,"mathews to dhawan, four runs, exposed all his stumps, risky but reaps the rewards with a slice through point! took it off the stumps and has timed it extremely well. he's very good at the square region"
79449,"muthuswami to warner, four runs, picks the gap at extra again, this one with a simpler extension of defence! sunriers have woken up now. six fours in the last two overs"
79452,"duminy to dhawan, out, off stump takes a hit! was expecting turn, possibly trying to slide it down to third man for a single, but duminy never turns the ball. he simply slides it on with the arm and exploits the gap between bat and pad when the batsmen expect the ball to deviate away. hands raised in a simple smile after the fact"

84542,"sharma to uthappa, out, captain's come up with another stunner! it was drummed into the covers after uthappa had made room to free his arms. it was a flatter delivery as well. the problem though was he didn't place it far enough from  warner, who dives low to his right and assures himself of a spot in the highlights of the match later"

89358,"morris to pandey, four runs, walks across the stumps and picks it behind square on the leg side. not entirely convincing but the ball flew off the bat. shreyas iyer at fine leg did all the hard work in getting to the ball, but palmed it over as he tried to push it back into the field of play"

89694,"harbhajan singh to gambhir, 2 runs, nudged away towards square leg, soft hands and placement imperative to two and gambhir does that excellently. southee picks up and fires a throw on the bounce but gambhir makes it. nice running."

89884,"negi to vohra, no run, driven to cover"
89886,"negi to vohra, 2 runs, out, dropped by a rickety-looking zaheer running back from cover, but the recovery is good enough that delhi capitalise on a run-out chance. vijay was looking for that extra cover loft again, but negi foxes him by holding the ball back. the batsman seemed to be reaching for it, the ball skewed up off the outside edge. zaheer couldn't make the most of the opportunity, but a mix-up between the two batsman offers another one and this time delhi do not miss. karun nair the man with a throw, and it zoomed in right at the base of the stumps for the wicketkeeper to do the rest"

93050,"sandeep sharma to uthappa, out, driven straight to cover and oh, is gambhir run out at the non-striker's end? he is surely miles outside the crease after he turned back but the confusion is whether sandeep's hands broke the stumps or the ball? replays from multiple angle confirm that the ball went through sandeep's hands and then to the stumps to dislodge the bails, gambhir is gone! it was driven to cover and maxwell got a direct hit from a tough angle, what was gambhir doing so far down the pitch!"

96223,"yadav to kohli, no run, flat outside off, turns in and kohli gets another inside edge onto his pad. went deep in his crease to play it"

96287,"morkel to dhawan, four runs, ooh, narine made it to the ball but didn't bend down enough. a hint of room, and with morkel's pace, dhawan had no qualms about slashing hard at the ball. it takes a thick outside edge, and third man is unable to stop it"

96303,"pathan to warner, 1 run, fired in, aiming at the top of off stump, driven past the diving pathan"
96308,"narine to warner, four runs, excellent awareness. narine starts off with a rare lose ball. it was too far down leg, so warner moved back, tucked it past the right of square leg inside the circle and to the left of the man on the boundary"

96336,"kuldeep yadav to henriques, out, beautiful comeback! it was a flatter delivery, the batsman picked that up early and set up for the heave over midwicket. only, he connects with the back of the bat and goes straight up! the bowler takes the catch himself. beautiful wrist-spin bowling from kuldeep"
96340,"narine to yuvraj singh, no run, "
96342,"narine to yuvraj singh, 2 runs, scooped! it was on leg stump and he simply played the line. went down on one knee and lifted it over his right shoulder. slip takes off after it"
96350,"sathish to yuvraj singh, four runs, slashed to the third man boundary. that's the problem with part-timers. their proclivity to bowl that one bad ball is a little higher than the specialists. this is wide outside off, yuvraj throws his bat at it and gets a thick outside edge over the fielders inside the circle"

96443,"henriques to gambhir, out, direct hit at point! yuvraj singh has produced a bit of magic! one stump to aim at, and he hits the target before munro could make his ground. gambhir had dinked the ball to point, yuvi hurtled up to it, got control of the ball in both hands, and whirled the throw in flat."
96453,"bipul sharma to gambhir, 1 run, tucked to deep midwicket, where hooda keeps it to a single"

96488,"sran to yadav, six runs, dropped by mustafiz at the third man boundary! it's off the outside half of the bat that was sailing towards the ropes. the fielder had to move a bit to his right, and it was coming at him at head-height. had moved in, and misjudged the catch in the first place. couldn't adjust thereafter. didn't look comfortable in that position and the ball pops out and over the boundary"
96514,"mustafizur rahman to holder, 1 leg bye, goes for a reverse dab, and it looked entirely premeditated. he was in no position to make a connection. hits him on the body. sathish is mindful of sneaking a quick single."
96520,"kumar to holder, out, another slower ball, holder wasn't quite well balanced when he went for the loft towards long-off. the ball hit high on the bat and carried only as far as long-off"

96562,"chahal to dhawan, 2 runs, chopped to point, a misfield from abdulla gives two"
96571,"iqbal abdulla to warner, 1 run, warner loads up for a big hit, abdulla is wary of it and darts it quicker on the legs, flicked behind square"
96576,"chahal to warner, four runs, chahal keeps bowling googlies. warner stays back and slaps it away to the cover boundary. warner acknowledges his half-century"

96653,"kumar to kohli, no run, much straighter now, no room at all, and kohli punches it back"
96654,"sran to gayle, 1 wide, not a great start, slightly slow at 129kph and down the leg side for a wide"
96658,"sran to gayle, 1 wide, another one down the leg side for a wide"

96671,"sran to gayle, no run, gayle winds up again. sran replies with a change-up ball. slower one, keeps gayle to a push to cover. he checked his shot and dabbed it to the off side"
96690,"henriques to kohli, no run, kohli steps out, bottom-hand dominates the drive to extra cover"
96719,"bipul sharma to kohli, four runs, bottom-handed whip, kohli's signature strike. arm-ball slides in, skips back and swats it wide of midwicket"

96796,"chahal to henriques, 1 run, nicely played. flat delivery outside off, pushed to long-off for a run. whoa, miscommunication. henriques should have been out. the fielder eases in, and throws the ball to the keeper. dhawan called yes, henriques hurries down for the second, and gives up but returns quickly when he sees the throw is to the keeper"

96869,"chahal to yuvraj singh, 1 run, oh, fantastic stuff from mandeep. a flat delivery outside off, so wide would have been called had yuvraj let that go. but he goes after it. yuvraj lays into a lofted drive towards long-off. mandeep runs to his right, and puts in a leaping, diving, one-handed effort. the ball just bounces out of his hands as mandeep is mid-air. five runs saved. didn't look to save the runs, wanted the catch. fantastic stuff."
96877,"choudhary to hooda, six runs, parried for six. rcb's woes continue. a slower ball on middle, hooda swings. high in the air, chahal moves back slowly, conscious of the boundary. in the end, he reverse-cups the parry over the boundary"

97178,"stanlake to samson, 3 runs, wide of the crease, angled in on off, whipped away square through the leg side. chahal chases and pushes the ball into the field of play or not. chahal was tantalisingly close to the boundary. looks like he is in contact with it while aiming to push the ball back. the tv umpire is happy with chahal's effort. just three"

97644,"sharma to de villiers, six runs, one more that sails over the roof. de villiers anticipates that the bowler would take it away from him, so he walks across early. gets right on top of it and smashes it over deep square leg. that was all timing and balance"

97778,"hh pandya to dhawan, 1 run,  dropped!  he's lost control of the ball on the dive but the ball bounced up and got stuck into his left elbow as he completed the dive. but there is some doubt here.this was struck really firmly by dhawan, krunal did well to move initially to his left and then dish in the dive. as he completed the catch, you couldn't quite see the ball. he thinks he's taken it but there was one point where he was completely covering the ball, which means the cameras couldn't quick pick if the ball hit the turf at that instant. no conclusive evidence."
97783,"mcclenaghan to warner, 1 run, too much width outside off, this one's hit hard to harbhajan at deep point"
97787,"mcclenaghan to warner, four runs, cracking shot. too much width, much slower in pace. sitting up nicely for warner who gives it a proper whack into the point boundary"

101683,"mohammed siraj to anderson, six runs, slower ball outside leg. that line was to counter anderson looking to make himself room. on this occasion anderson spotted it early and just whipped it over the square leg boundary"

101823,"sandeep sharma to mandeep singh, no run, swing there as usual for sandeep, brings it into mandeep who defends the ball to leg"
101824,"sandeep sharma to mandeep singh, 1 run, he wants a quick single, gayle is scrambling to the keeper's end as mohit swoops in from mid-on to fire a throw but misses. it was another inswinger, sltraighter this time, which mandeep pushed to mid-on with a straight bat"
101826,"sandeep sharma to gayle, out, comes down and hands a catch straight to point! it was another swinging delivery from sandeep, gayle walked down in line with the leg stump and the ball swung enough to take the outside edge and fly straight to the fielder"

101839,"sandeep sharma to kohli, out, he's got kohli too, clean bowled! kohli charged down quickly, it was an inswinger from sandeep which pitched around off and middle and came in, kohli swung hard and missed it completely. what a blow for rcb, what accurate bowling from sandeep"
101840,"sandeep sharma to de villiers, no run, there's an appeal for a run out as ab drove that dead straight and it hit the stumps at non-striker's end. sandeep is claiming it touched his fingers and replays show it did. it looks like mandeep's bat was down just in time but the third umpire wants to be 120% sure. not out gives the local crowd some relief"

101844,"aaron to mandeep singh, four runs, makes a bit of room and slices that with a thickish edge just over and wide of point! aaron wasn't giving too much room so he made some on his own and gave it enough aerial route to keep it far from point"

101883,"patel to mandeep singh, 1 run, darts it towards off stump, pushed into the covers for one"
101885,"patel to watson, 1 run, slower through the air outside off, helped wide of point for one more"

101989,"mohammed shami to patel, no run, looks to help this to fine leg, but the ball lobs on the bounce off the back of the bat to midwicket. for a moment, parthiv wasn't sure where it went and took off for a single, only to be sent back.  he would've been gone if there was a direct hit at the striker's end.

102099,"malinga to anderson, four runs, belts it away. there is room to free the arms, and those arms have a lot of strength in them. anderson was belting these every third ball when he made the then fastest century in odis on new years day a few years ago"

102117,"harbhajan singh to cummins, out, gorgeous bowling. he's bowling the doosra again! for so long, he had hidden this delivery. but now he's wrapped cummins up in a nice little bow. the batsman is caught in his crease, he plays for the ball turning into him, trying to milk a single to midwicket. instead he edges it to the wicketkeeper and parthiv does really well to take the catch too"

102180,"narine to head, no run, there's an appeal for a stumping. narine turned it away from the batsman, who looked to drive and missed, jackson whipped the bails off immediately but head's back toe never left the crease"

102241,"de grandhomme to mandeep singh, 1 run, doesn't nip in as much as he expects, it's slowish too and a thick outside edge goes towards point"
102314,"choudhary to de grandhomme, no run, and again. ultimate moral victory for aniket. it's the only one he'll get tonight. beats the bat thrice, again outside off as he looks to punch this away from the body"

106161,"gopal to de villiers, no run, spins back in, defended to the leg side. sharp turn"
106167,"laughlin to kohli, no run, steps out but gets yorked nearly as this tails in a long way. ab was more than halfway down the pitch when he was sent back but buttler doesn't pick up the ball cleanly. run-out chance missed."
106168,"laughlin to kohli, 1 run, walks across and whips this on the bounce to deep midwicket"
106170,"laughlin to de villiers, six runs, he's sliced this over deep extra cover, seemed a mishit but boy, this has carried all the way."
106174,"gopal to mandeep singh, 1 run, eased with the spin to long-off"
106180,"unadkat to de villiers, 1 run, makes room and punches this down to long-off. can't get the kind of room he would've liked. that's three good deliveries so far from unadkat"
106185,"gopal to de villiers, no run, this one keeps low to beat the underedge as he looked to punch"
106187,"gopal to negi, 1 run, squeezes this flick to square leg, off the mark"
106194,"gowtham to negi, 1 run, goes back deep into the crease and whips this down to deep midwicket"
106200,"laughlin to washington sundar, 1 wide, gets the line wrong, way down leg. good take by buttler"

106203,"stokes to washington sundar, 1 wide, slants this way outside off. saw the batsman making room but bowled it really wide"
106204,"stokes to washington sundar, 1 run, makes room and punches this to wide mid-off, good stop."
106208,"stokes to washington sundar, no run, through with the swing again, failed to account for the slower delivery"
106215,"unadkat to mandeep singh, no run, walks across to flick, ends up yorking himself."
106222,"stokes to washington sundar, four runs, carved away over backward point. lovely from washington, making a case as a batsman too. amidst his new ball ability, it's conveniently forgotten that he plays in the top order for his state side tamil nadu"
106239,"chahar to rahul, four runs, ah, shot! the aesthetic value of that is just unbelievable. rahul simply leans into a punch through the covers, in the process covering for the late movement and using the pace to his advantage as he throws his weight behind it"
106242,"harbhajan singh to gayle, no run, comes down the track and pats it away against the turn towards mid-on"
106246,"chahar to gayle, no run, ah, has he got away with that? seemed to drift a long way from the left-hander, nowhere near gayle's reach, but for some reason, the umpire thought that was fine"
106254,"harbhajan singh to gayle, 1 run, leg-side line again, he needs to settle into something here, gayle waits and tucks it behind square for one"
106256,"harbhajan singh to rahul, no run, steps out to one that drifts into him and goes slightly inside-out to extra cover"
106258,"thakur to gayle, four runs, edged and through the gap between keeper and wide slip. that's an unusually wide slip, probably even wider of where second slip would have been. that means gayle can take liberties at throwing his hands at deliveries that are well outside his reach"
106292,"harbhajan singh to agarwal, four runs, brilliant from agarwal. uses the width to open the face really late and squeezes it out through backward point"
106299,"bravo to agarwal, no run, "
106327,"thakur to yuvraj singh, out, is that an edge? oh, yeah! tucked up for room and some extra bounce too that does him in. yuvraj is trying to slap this over but gets a feather to the keeper. gone for 20 but he kings xi will be pleased he didn't scratch around"
106352,"bravo to nair, out, goes for a big heave over the leg side and he's picked out jadeja at deep midwicket who takes it reverse-cupped. slower ball from bravo does the trick as he messes up the timing by rolling his fingers over this delivery"
106357,"sran to vijay, 1 wide, starts the inswinger too straight again. strays down leg, wide!"
106380,"sharma to vijay, 1 run, flicked to square leg"
106381,"tye to vijay, out, sran with another catch and he's too chuffed again as he hurls the ball in the air. vijay steps down the track, completely foxed by the slower one from tye, and chips it in the air. sran snaffles it at extra cover"
106387,"mujeeb ur rahman to rayudu, 1 run, there's that deceptive trajectory right away, rayudu reaches out and gets an outside edge to third man"
106389,"mujeeb ur rahman to billings, 1 run, shifts back and punches this past mid-on diving to his left"
106392,"mujeeb ur rahman to rayudu, 1 run, turned away with the spin to backward square leg"
106397,"ashwin to dhoni, 1 run, another legbreak, make that three in a row, dhoni reaches out and drives to long-off"
106401,"yuvraj singh to rayudu, 1 run, "

106409,"ashwin to rayudu, 1 wide, sprayed down the leg side"
106410,"ashwin to rayudu, no run, finds the outside edge with turn ad bounce from middle and leg as the ball trickles away into the off side"
106411,"ashwin to rayudu, 1 wide, drifts it in down the leg side again"

106437,"ashwin to rayudu, 1 run, comes down the track and drills to long-off"
106440,"sran to rayudu, no run, back-of-the-hand slower delivery, rayudu backs away and leaves it hoping for a wide. but well inside"
106441,"sran to rayudu, out, ashwin with a direct hit. and look at him take off. and look at the kings xi dugout. a lightning quick piece of fielding from ashwin. rayudu drills it to extra cover and ashwin just swoops down in a flash and nails a direct hit at the striker's end after dhoni sends rayudu back"
106443,"sran to jadeja, no run, another yes and no. dhoni sends jadeja back but he manages to get back in comfortably after tapping a slower one to midwicket"
106452,"sran to jadeja, 1 wide, slower ball, dips late and sneaks down the leg side"
106479,"sharma to dhoni, 1 wide, tries an encore and it's drifted away too much. tension building. mohit needs to hold his own here. dhoni has loads of experience in these situations. injured back or not, you don't want to be bowling to him in these situations"
106488,"boult to lynn, no run, beats the off stump! lynn exposes the stumps and it looks like he's anticipating the ball to swing into him from an off stump line. wants to drill it through cover, but this ball goes straight through with the angle"
106565,"morris to karthik, four runs, one ball after being dispatched for four, morris offers the same delivery again, and karthik responds with the same shot. through midwicket"
106566,"morris to karthik, out, and attempts a third hit through the same region, but gambhir had boult from square leg after those two boundaries, and karthik knocks it straight into the hands of the fielder there"
106568,"morris to rana, no run, tapped to point and he is sent back"
106570,"mohammed shami to rana, 1 run, slower ball again, finds the inside edge of rana's bat as he tries to drill it through the off side"
106588,"boult to russell, out, bowled him! very good delivery from boult, almost the perfect delivery to russell. fires it in around leg stump and rolls his fingers over it to slow it up. it then dips really late with russell swinging for the fences, and takes out leg stump"
106595,"morris to rana, no run, goes deep in his crease and tries to jab it through point but gets the bottom edge and rolls down the pitch"
106596,"morris to rana, out, slower ball, miscues as he tries to loft it over the off side and sends it soaring into the sky. gambhir settles under it at cover. end of a top innings"
106601,"tewatia to shubman gill, out, tame! very soft dismissal. a bit of room outside off and he flays this with a flat bat, but picks out point. gill having a tough start to his ipl career"
106603,"tewatia to chawla, no run, really slows it up and gets it to skid across without turn, chawla swings and misses"
106604,"tewatia to chawla, out, chawla comes down the track for a big hit. a non-turner again, pretty wide of chawla, and he was probably expecting it to turn into him, but as he doesn't, he skews it in the air off the outside of the bat and the keeper settles under it"
106611,"chawla to roy, 1 wide, out, leg-side stumping! roy loses his balance completely. it's a slider down leg side that keeps going away from him as he walks down the pitch for some reason. has to reach out a long way for the flick and he won't get there. karthik's toughest task there is gathering the ball. he does that properly and then the stumping is relatively easy"
106648,"chawla to pant, four runs, well played. it's a quicker one from chawla and he's a little late getting back on this. chops it very very late to get it past backward point"
106700,"yadav to lewis, 1 run, shapes back in late, driven to mid-on as they scamper a quick single"

106728,"mohammed siraj to lewis, 1 run, toe-ends a lofted hit to mid-on, they scamper a run even as ab's throw misses the stumps at the bowler's end"
106733,"woakes to lewis, no run, can't split the gap at cover. timed superbly but straight to cover."
106734,"woakes to lewis, no run, sees the batsman trying to move across and bowls this wide, left alone in anticipation of this being called wide, but this isn't."
106751,"chahal to lewis, no run, "
106754,"anderson to sharma, four runs, slapped past cover! half-tracker on off and angling across rohit. he comes dancing down the wicket and hits this through the ball's line. goes through cover and mid off"
106766,"anderson to lewis, out, top edged, and taken! de kock gets under it and completes a swirling catch. tried to flat-bat this over mid on, with the ball angling into lewis' body, but he's through his shot too early, and comes off the toe end. it was in the air for a long time, and qdk had to run backwards for a while before the ball came back to earth"
106774,"mohammed siraj to kh pandya, no run, half-tracker on middle stump, but bowls very straight. krunal rocks back and check-drives back to siraj. aggression from the bowler, who takes a aim at krunal's stumps... but doesn't throw it in the end"
106790,"anderson to sharma, four runs, width and he's hammered this to the point boundary like a - insert your favourite word -  tracer bullet "

106798,"yadav to pollard, 1 run, thick outside edge to third man as he looks to slice this towards point"
106815,"woakes to sharma, 1 run, lofted over the infield, down to deep cover."
106845,"mustafizur rahman to kohli, no run, slower ball, on off stump. kohli's forced to check his attempted drive, and taps it with soft hands to point instead. wants the single, but eventually chooses not to. smart choice"
106867,"kh pandya to mandeep singh, 1 run, direct hit! quicker ball, flat on off, and that's been pushed to mid off for a quick run. the throw is flat, and mandeep, totally outstretched, is on the crease. does he have any part of the bat over the line? this is too tough to call. not out."
106967,"narine to rahane, four runs, bam, two fours in a row. jumps out of his crease early, slightly premeditated, to reach the pitch of this flat one outside off, and frees his arms to beat mid-off to his right"
106995,"kuldeep yadav to d'arcy, no run, gets a good stride and smothers this."
106998,"shivam mavi to samson, four runs, ah, lovely. square third man was no more than 10 yards away from the ball but couldn't get around. just a hint of width, samson opens the bat face to steer this behind point. lovely timing."

107080,"kulkarni to narine, no run, looks to slap this over point, toe-ends it to cover instead"
107081,"kulkarni to narine, four runs, thick outside edge as he attempts to slash over point, but this one flies over buttler's outstretched hands behind the stumps. streaky boundary"

107091,"kulkarni to narine, no run, cracked away but can't pierce the off side ring, hit straight to cover point"

107399,"tye to williamson, out, holes out to long off. stepped out and looked to loft over long off but ended up slicing it, which meant there was no timing. skewed it high in the air, finch took a comfortable catch. the knuckleball meant williamson didn't have any pace to work with."

107534,"gopal to billings, out, picks out deep midwicket. csk are having something of a slide on the end opposite to watson's. it's a half-tracker from gopal. which is smart of him, because that's how you get wickets in the ipl if you're a spinner now. sits up nicely on middle stump and he slaps it, flat, to stokes in the deep"

107811,"boult to de kock, no run, "
107813,"boult to vohra, no run, huuuuuuge appeal for lbw but the umpire isn't swayed by it. beautiful bowling from boult, pitching up to the new batsman, getting the ball to curl into him late. vohra is not at all ready for the fiendish delivery. he tries to play a shot into the leg side and possibly gets an inside edge? cause otherwise that kinda looks plumb"
107835,"nadeem to kohli, out, horrendous running and de kock has ended up sacrificing his wicket. there is no run there. de kock thinks so, but his no either isn't accepted or isn't heard, as kohli keeps taking strides down the pitch as he watches the ball roll towards backward point. in the end, kohli is halfway down, de kock is stranded and he crosses over to give his wicket away"
107882,"patel to de villiers, four runs, dismisses it to the boundary - he was eyeing midwicket, but he'll settle for extra cover. mr 360 at his very best, starting things off by moving across outside off to open up the leg side. but harshal one-ups him by bowling wide, as far wide as he dares. but ab raises the game with a blistering lofted drive for his fifty, off only 24 balls"

107891,"tewatia to de villiers, 1 run, sets up for a heave again, but seeing the leg break turn a slight bit more than he budgets for, hits it along the ground to deep cover"
107898,"morris to de villiers, 1 run, top edge but with the ball going only as far as the 30 yard circle, and everyone on the leg side in the deep, ab's very very safe"
107904,"boult to anderson, out, 144. 8 kph. and it's good enough to beat anderson, who is swinging for the fences. done by pure pace. this is what the non-millenials say you miss, i hit."

107946,"stanlake to raina, four runs, raina manufactures a boundary for csk. he backs a long way outside leg, stanlake chases him, sliced in the gap at backward point. third man can't track it down either"

108063,"thakur to hooda, 1 run, "
108069,"chahar to hooda, out, easy catch at extra cover. hooda pre-meditates and shuffles too early. it's the slower ball again and he goes through with the flick early to get a leading edge that jadeja runs back a few inches to take"
108085,"jadeja to shakib al hasan, no run, a bit of width, opens up and drops it to point"

108100,"watson to williamson, 2 runs, "
108107,"sharma to pathan, no run, big swing and a miss from yusuf. zero feet, and against the turn and angle. dhoni whips the bails off in a flash, and wait, has the backfoot been planted back? yusuf just dragged it out but he's managed to ground his foot just in time"

108173,"gowtham to ishan kishan, 1 run, flat on middle and leg, nudged into the gap at midwicket for a run. nicely played, soft hands, off the mark."
108175,"gowtham to yadav, no run, flat outside off, a big extravagant swing, but the drift takes the ball past the outside edge."
108181,"kulkarni to ishan kishan, no run, a slower ball outside off, good change in pace, and angle (the ball going away instead of coming in). pushed to cover point."
108196,"unadkat to yadav, 1 run, a slower ball on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on. suryakumar called for one immediately (it was his call). kishan doesn't completely trust the call, there's some hesitation but even with a direct hit at the batsman's end, all good."
108202,"gowtham to yadav, 2 runs, flat on off, but he gets some turn. that's why an attempted drive results in a thick inside edge through square leg. two runs"
108204,"gowtham to ishan kishan, 1 run, flat on middle and leg, flicked away towards square leg for a run."
108209,"gopal to yadav, 1 wide, looking for the seam-up one, 115 kph. waaaay down leg. buttler does well to prevent five wides."
108293,"mcclenaghan to tripathi, 1 wide, not been a great start in terms of line. this one drifts down leg for a wide."
108303,"kh pandya to tripathi, out, picks out mid-on! i'm not sure what kind of a shot that was. flat and straight, tripathi just chips a drive to mid-on, did he try to go over? or past him? that does not seem like a very clever shot, did it hold up? something definitely did happen that resulted in a tame bunt to the fielder. krunal doesn't care."
108305,"kh pandya to samson, four runs, edged through the vacant slip region for four. a bit of width, flat and wider. a thick edge goes flying away for four. krunal got some turn on that."
108310,"mustafizur rahman to samson, four runs, slightly wider outside off, allowing samson to throw his hands at the ball. finds the timing and the placement, into the gap at cover."
108315,"kh pandya to samson, 1 run, flat and straight, nudged to deep midwicket for one"
108316,"kh pandya to rahane, 1 run, flicked against the spin again. flat and wide outside off, drag-flicked to mid-on"
108337,"mustafizur rahman to samson, 1 run, a slower ball outside off, samson opens the bat face and guides the ball to backward point for a run."
108341,"markande to stokes, 1 run, half-tracker on off, and it's the wrong'un this time. stokes says on the backfoot and punches to long off"
108353,"mcclenaghan to samson, 2 runs, drilled towards the leg side, but played softly enough to come back for the second"
108391,"bumrah to buttler, out, the zing bails light up! super fast (144kph) on off stump and angling right into buttler. he tries to defend it straight, but the ball goes between bat and pad. crashes into middle stump"
108438,"plunkett to rahul, four runs, mis-timed but still four. a slower delivery around off, rahul mis-times an attempted lofted drive, the ball skews off the inside half, plonks over mid-on and races away."
108449,"christian to agarwal, 1 run, a slower ball on middle and leg, nudged away to deep square leg for a run."
108474,"maxwell to yuvraj singh, 1 run, drilled through to deep cover"
108479,"mishra to yuvraj singh, 2 runs, turns this gently with the spin towards deep fine leg, lazy effort in the deep. should've just been one"
108489,"avesh khan to miller, no run, this is a stunning delivery. bowled at 145 clicks, whizzes across and beats miller's push. pant collected that over his head."
108490,"avesh khan to miller, 1 run, pushed through the line to mid-off for a quick single. avesh bowls out and he's had a superb debut with daredevils"
108498,"tewatia to miller, no run, goes back into the crease and defends this skiddy delivery"
108499,"tewatia to miller, 1 run,  dropped by maxwell at cover!  what's worse is they concede an overthrow. miller rocks back and slaps this straight. both feet were in the air as he went for the catch sideways and it popped out. reprieves his old mate"

108542,"rajpoot to gambhir, no run, nervous little poke to an away-going delivery, didn't miss the edge by much"
108543,"rajpoot to gambhir, no run, big appeal for lbw. gambhir was on his toes when he was struck. height was surely in question there, but no. ashwin thinks otherwise and has asked for a review.. pitch map shows this hit the turf outside leg,  so nothing else matters."
108548,"sran to shaw, four runs, slashes and gets a thick outside edge that flies over the slip fielder."
108551,"rajpoot to gambhir, 1 run, dabs this gently into the off side as they scamper a single.  an under-arm flick from agarwal at point and shaw may have been gone "
108554,"rajpoot to maxwell, no run, crunching drive, super stop at point by yuvraj. threw himself to his left to effect a one-handed stop"
108556,"tye to maxwell, 1 run, squeezes the drive to mid off for a quick single"

108558,"tye to gambhir, 1 leg bye, hint of curve back in to hit the pad as gambhir looks to flick. he was slightly off balance. big appeal, but no review. replays confirm this pitched outside leg."
108560,"tye to maxwell, no run, steps out to whack this slower ball into the neighbouring football stadium, but misses. swung through too early. head all over the place"
108561,"tye to maxwell, no run, is there an edge there? thought i heard something. maxwell looks to run this off the bat face wide of the keeper."

108575,"tye to iyer, 5 runs, turns this slower delivery from outside off towards midwicket. oh, dear. four overthrows, so make that five. miller throws to the bowler's end, but tye misses. finch, backing up, also misses as this squeezes below him"

108624,"ashwin to tewatia, 1 run, flat outside off, tewatia goes back and punches one to long-off for one."

108653,"sran to plunkett, out, a golden duck for plunkett. a slower delivery down leg from sran. excellent variation, because plunkett meets the ball much earlier than he intended. as a result, a whip intended for midwicket goes aerially to deep square leg, where nair takes a comfortable catch."
108655,"sran to mishra, 1 run, he walks right across and connects neatly with the lap scoop but he finds the keeper. it's a slower delivery well outside off. that missed off stump by not much. iyer forces him to complete the run."
108659,"mujeeb ur rahman to iyer, six runs, six! not over yet. it's flat and wide, iyer stands back and slaps a swat straight back over the bowler's head for six. sensational timing. delhi are dancing again."

108663,"mujeeb ur rahman to iyer, out, taken at long-off and kings xi win by four runs. gambhir has his head in his hands. iyer looks up. a flatter trajectory delivery outside off is chipped away to long-off. finch takes the reverse-cupped catch and kings xi begin their celebrations."

108768,"mustafizur rahman to kaul, out, run-out! terrible from sunrisers. they've had a shocking evening. a slower ball outside off, kaul finally gets bat on it. slices a drive to point. hardik pandya misfields, which makes kaul think there is a single. pathan comes running down, sees pandya's throw is coming and returns back to his crease, allowing kaul to sacrifice himself. the ball pops out of kishan's gloves, just as he made contact with the stumps"
108773,"bumrah to pathan, 2 runs, smashed down to long-off. a slower ball is hammered back past the bowler. bumrah sticks out his right hand, but the ball flies past. pollard throws to the batsman's end, but he's fine"
108795,"sandeep sharma to lewis, no run, beats the outside edge and gets him on the back leg. squares him up once again. this is not easy living for lewis. looking to tap that through midwicket and he's struck outside off on the back thigh"

108883,"kaul to bumrah, 1 run, dhawan flies to his right and can't hold on! oh what a catch that would have been! kaul gets it to rise in the corridor and bumrah fends at it with hard hands. it is sailing high and very wide of dhawan at wide slip. he does superbly to even reach it. but can only parry it to third man"
108909,"chahar to de kock, 1 run, makes some room this time, it's a slower ball and he patiently pushes it into off for one"
108914,"harbhajan singh to de kock, no run, some room outside off, he goes after it and drives it along the ground to cover"
108917,"harbhajan singh to de kock, no run, little flatter, de kock goes hard at it outside off but doesn't quite middle it"

108985,"jadeja to mandeep singh, 4 byes, that turn beats the batsman and dhoni! it pitched on leg stump, maybe even outside, mandeep looked to work it to leg and that turned a mile to miss the off stump while mandeep came out of the crease and dhoni missed the ball too"

109252,"ashwin to pathan, six runs, dropped at deep midwicket, this time it's tiwary, waiting on the edge of the boundary, having very little room to manoeuvre. that makes him nervous and that makes him lose it. yusuf lives to swing across the line again"

117704,"shakib al hasan to watson, six runs, flat outside leg stump, and watson goes down on one knee and thumps it over deep backward square leg! what a classy way to get to your fifty. a freebie to start his spell"
117715,"brathwaite to watson, 1 run, slower ball to end the over. it's wide outside off, so watson is forced to reach at it. flat-bats it past the bowler's left, and takes a single to keep the strike"

117774,"chahar to kohli, 1 no ball, slower one goes wrong it's slipped out of his hands and gone over kohli's head, so it's a no-ball. free hit coming up."
117800,"harbhajan singh to de villiers, 2 runs, tahir has dropped ab at deep square leg that would have been nail in coffin with undertaker's music playing, but ab gets a life. swept from leg-stump, gets a top edge, and tahir makes a hash of it"

118067,"russell to warner, 1 run, driven to cover"

118210,"shakib al hasan to russell, 1 wide, russell stays put and shakib second guesses him by firing it down leg. that will be a wide"

118247,"hh pandya to dhawan, four runs, width and he's belted that through extra cover. tracer bullet stuff. this was a poor ball, loose first up."
118250,"hh pandya to dhawan, 1 run, flayed through to deep point"

118279,"kh pandya to ingram, no run,ê"
118335,"bumrah to pant, 1 leg bye, wow. slower ball, angling into leg stump. pant looks for the reverse-swat, with both third man and backward point inside the circle, but he's undone by lack of pace, and only manages a leg bye into the point region"

118349,"sharma to sharma, four runs, outside edge goes for four would you believe it, the ball after slip has gone, rohit drives away from his body and gets a thick outside edge that goes for four"
118391,"paul to yuvraj singh, no run, backs away to give himself room but smart by keemo, who pushes it wide of off stump. yuvraj can't reach that, and it's another dot ball"

118637,"ashwin to rahane, out, bowled him! carrom ball, straightens towards off stump and skids off the pitch. rahane was looking to stay leg-side of the ball and steer this down to third man. ended up playing inside the line and the ball crashes into off stump"

118664,"ashwin to buttler, 1 run,"
118665,"ashwin to samson, out, ashwin has mankaded buttler here. and has appealed. buttler is furious. replays confirm buttler was well outside his crease. he has to go back, not the best of the scenes here. also, did ashwin stop in his action and waited for buttler to leave his crease? i think yes, but third umpire has ruled it out and buttler has to go"
118671,"rajpoot to smith, 1 no ball, slower one outside off, smith looks to send it out of the stadium, misses completely but wait, that's another no-ball. even bigger than the last one"
118679,"curran to smith, 1 wide, moves across again but it's way down the leg side, smith throws his bat at it but cannot connect"

118713,"chahar to shaw, no run, hangs back and typically legside of the ball to tap it towards cover. hint of away movement off the pitch from chahar."
118726,"chahar to dhawan, four runs, outside edge. he doesn't move his feet, tentatively pushes the bat at a pitched-up outswinger. gets lucky with a thick edge to third man"
118742,"chahar to iyer, 1 run, gets inside the line of a ball sliding into leg stump and flicks it to deep square leg"
118746,"harbhajan singh to dhawan, no run, skids into him again, without turning, and almost seeming to hasten after pitching. dhawan manages to squirt it to cover"
118748,"harbhajan singh to dhawan, 1 run,"
118751,"chahar to dhawan, 1 run, steps out and has to deal with another ball - this one angled across - bouncing a little more than he expects. manages to get under it and lift over point"
118756,"chahar to iyer, no run, excellent bowling again, targeting the top of off, and also getting it to straighten enough to keep shreyas to a block to point. wraps up his spell 4-0-20-1"
118761,"harbhajan singh to iyer, no run, loops it up on off stump, defends"
118764,"jadeja to iyer, 1 run, slices it to point and sprints across for a quick single. jadeja knocks the bails off even as the point fielder throws so there's no real danger"
118766,"jadeja to iyer, 1 run, eases it through point"
118768,"jadeja to dhawan, no run, defended back to the bowler"
118780,"jadeja to iyer, no run, how'd that miss! angled in, flat, from wide of the crease, and it straightens past the outside edge as iyer reaches out for a push into the off side. so close to off stump"
118841,"sharma to rayudu, no run, hit the deck though and you bring in uncertainty. the ball might stop on the batsman. ishant tries his best with that ploy and keeps rayudu to a block"
118848,"patel to watson, 1 run, eases the ball to mid-on and then sprints through"
118857,"rabada to watson, no run,ê"
118878,"mishra to watson, 1 wide, out, huge appeal for a stumping. and it all starts with some sexy bowling from mishy. tosses it up. tempting the batsman. luring him into a big shot over the covers. bringing him out of his crease and then making him lose his shape thanks to the amount of turn off the pitch. now all that's left is for pant to collect the ball and break the stumps and he does it in style"
118879,"mishra to jadhav, no run, flatter delivery outside off, jadhav goes back and blocks it"
118927,"patel to dhoni, no run, nicely bowled. gets some dip on it as dhoni reaches out to defend. goes on with the angle and it rolls into the leg side off the inside edge"
118945,"paul to dhoni, 1 wide, slower ball, sixth-stump line, left alone. was it really that wide, marais erasmus? borderline call - seemed to finish inside the tramline for me"

118968,"varun to narine, four runs, honked through midwicket! that's another calculatedly aggressive mow. no need for finesse, just pummel it to the rope!"
118970,"varun to narine, six runs, sliding down the leg side, and launched over backward square! yeegads, narine's at it again!"
118971,"mohammed shami to lynn, four runs, leans back and monstered over the covers! kxi's fine start is a distant memory!"
118974,"mohammed shami to lynn, out, right underneath it! that's threatening a few satellites as it soars into the kolkata (k)night ... miller calls for it, braces for impact as it drops to earth like a comet, and falls to the turf to cushion the catch! great hands"
118977,"viljoen to uthappa, no run, outside off, pushed through to the keeper on a wide line. a precious dot"
118988,"tye to uthappa, 1 run, poked to the off side"
118989,"tye to rana, no run, firm defence to complete a very tight over. it's been a mixed bag from kxi so far, but they've settled after that raucous second over"
118992,"ashwin to uthappa, no run, wider line, attempted slap through the covers but can't connect"
118995,"ashwin to rana, no run, a swish across the line, half an appeal for lbw but clearly outside the line"
118996,"varun to uthappa, four runs, too wide, chopped backward of the diving point and clean to the rope!"

119011,"tye to rana, 1 run, outside off, another slower ball, and tapped to the covers"
119017,"ashwin to uthappa, 1 run, looks like a carrom ball on leg stump, he flicks it through midwicket"
119029,"ashwin to rana, 1 wide, the carrom ball goes way too wide outside off"
119030,"ashwin to rana, six runs, w-o-w! this is the offbreak and ashwin tries his hardest to keep it out of reach of rana outside off. but the left-hander reaches out - while somehow still not losing his shape - and flat-bats it over long-off"
119042,"viljoen to rana, 1 run, slower ball - good thinking against a rampaging batsman on an easy-paced pitch - rana dabs it at around square leg to pinch a single"
119043,"viljoen to uthappa, 2 runs, splendid timing as he gets down low to the off-pace delivery outside off and steers it past point. could easily have gone to the boundary without agarwal diving to his left on the boundary"
119056,"viljoen to russell, 1 run, slower ball on middle and off, russell blocks into the covers - uncharacteristically gently - and sets off"
119057,"viljoen to uthappa, four runs, flicks it fine and all the way to the boundary to bring up his fifty. that's also the timeout"
119082,"tye to uthappa, four runs, okay, lets unwrap this. first he moves his back leg outside leg. then he leaps across his stumps. then he has to deal with a slower ball and even through all that he somehow keeps his head and dabs it behind point and all the way to the boundary."
119086,"prasidh krishna to gayle, no run, a flat-footed mow, wide of off stump and through to the keeper"
119087,"prasidh krishna to gayle, four runs, spanged through finer third man! a thick edge, too thin for the fielder, and an unsuspecting cameraman by the dugout wears it on the shoulder!"
119088,"prasidh krishna to gayle, no run, a round-house swing at thin air! good lift off the deck. well then, this is living up to the billing already!"
119091,"ferguson to rahul, no run, width outside off, hitting the deck harder, and rahul can't connect with a flash of the wrists"

119095,"prasidh krishna to agarwal, 1 wide, takes off down the leg side, lots of pace and bounce, but the wrong line ..."
119097,"prasidh krishna to agarwal, four runs, clouted over the covers! that's supreme batting, a fraction of room to the leg side, opens up the off, and creams his drive over the ring and away to the rope!"
119098,"prasidh krishna to agarwal, no run, opens the face this time from deep in the crease but can't create the angle to beat point"
119100,"prasidh krishna to agarwal, no run, gives room to the leg side again, but that's a good response from the bowler, rolling his fingers on a slower ball outside off, and mayank can't reach it"
119102,"ferguson to gayle, no run, sharp delivery, hits the seam and jags past the squared-up batsman"
119105,"ferguson to gayle, no run, rolls the fingers again, gayle steps back, deep into his crease to defend. keeping it solid while he finds his range ..."
119112,"russell to khan, four runs, cor, that's a shot and a half! an inverted jack-in-the-box, squashing himself like a concertina, down into the crease, then ramping the ball off his nose and over the keeper! you need good knees for that stroke!"

119128,"russell to khan, four runs, opens the face, glided down to the third man fence, using the pace well"
119129,"russell to khan, out, attempted wipe over the leg side, but karthik simply jogs round behind the stumps and swallows another loose top-edge! easy pickings for kkr, and they've got themselves a stranglehold now ..."

119156,"narine to miller, 1 run, flicks it through midwicket"
119173,"kuldeep yadav to agarwal, 2 runs, dropped by cover running to his left. it's rinku singh subbing for uthappa. the batsman is deceived as he comes down the track, kuldeep keeping the ball wide of off stump to deny him the hitting base. the miscue goes out square on the off side and though it's a tough catch, rinku having to run quite a distance and dive, it should have been taken"
119179,"chawla to mandeep singh, 1 run, another one the turns the wrong way from the legspinner. mandeep flicks it to deep square leg"

119209,"yadav to de kock, 1 run, lovely drive to the left of mid-off, where siraj puts in the dive and stops a boundary. umesh will keep pitching the ball up there. that's his strength in the powerplay. (but good batsmen can turn it into a weakness too)"
119216,"saini to sharma, four runs, inside edge! and it's the result of rohit being unprepared for the pace and movement. saini hits the deck at 144 kph and gets the ball to dart into the right-hander, who tentatively brings his bat down and is lucky not to chop on"
119224,"yadav to de kock, four runs, heaves it between midwicket and mid-on! that's a de kock special, right from his disdainful walk down the pitch against the fast bowler and the fast hands that help him put so much power on the shot"
119240,"saini to de kock, four runs, dropped at midwicket. it's hit so very hard. but it's coming straight to de grandhomme. he has to get up off his feet, stick his hands above his head, and then hope it sticks. (hint, it doesn't)"

119335,"mcclenaghan to ali, 1 run, another leading edge as moeen is done in by a hint of movement off the pitch. mcclenaghan hits the deck hard and that helps him generate a little bit of magic. not enough to get a wicket though as the ball wanders in the air behind point"

127760,"m ashwin to de villiers, 1 run, was this an edge? yes! this is a delightful delivery from ashwin, gripping and spinning across de villiers, who pokes at it and sends an edge flying past the keeper. slip would have gobbled it up, and that's the hundred"

127846,"saini to rahul, four runs, edged to third man! saini finds the channel outside off, and rahul just hangs his bat out at it. there's no slip in place, so it's relatively safe to go fishing. and he's got four for it"

127886,"washington sundar to pooran, six runs, and again! pooran backs himself to blast another one clear of the long off fielder, and though he doesn't quite get all of this one, it goes the distance"
127888,"washington sundar to pooran, six runs, third one in the over! and it's in exactly the same spot. pooran shimmies and makes room, slamming a 90-metre six into the stands beyond long off"
127894,"saini to miller, 2 runs, a diving chahal saves runs! he had some work to do after miller timed a slash very well behind square, making ground from third man and then diving to save two"
127899,"ali to pooran, six runs, a fourth six over long off! pooran knows where his strength lies. he backs away to put a straight delivery right in his arc, slamming it way over long off"

127910,"yadav to pooran, 1 run, pooran has almost swung himself off his feet trying to hit this, but it comes on to him just a bit too quickly and he toe-ends it down to long off"
127913,"yadav to miller, 1 wide,"
127914,"yadav to miller, 1 run, quick single! miller taps to cover and they just set off. a direct hit would have been interesting"
127920,"saini to mandeep singh, 1 run,"
127924,"yadav to viljoen, out, gloved down the leg side, and this game is safe now. umesh greets his fellow quick hardus with a bumper first up, and he can only get a glove on it. parthiv makes ground and tumbles to his left to hold the low, dipping chance, and yadav is on a hat trick as the chinnaswamy finds its voice once more"

127944,"aaron to rana, 2 runs, slower ball outside off, swerved away from rana as he went for the expansive drive, nicked it behind but beat the diving slip fielder to his left for a single to third-man"

128316,"hh pandya to vijay, six runs, straight over the bowler! he was looking, perhaps, to go over mid-off. but he hasn't picked the slower ball from pandya. luckily for him, not too much pace off that ball and it pings off the middle with his extension and comfortably clears the straight boundary"
128321,"kh pandya to rayudu, out, straight through him! that's the perfect arm ball if there is one. 99kph, skidding straight on and hitting the top of middle stump before rayudu can gauge what's happened. he's driving for the turn, on the rise, outside off. it skids straight on"
